Spanish cuisine (Spanish: Cocina española) consists of the traditions and practices of Spanish cooking. It features considerable regional diversity, with important differences between the traditions of each part of Spain (see #Regional cuisines).
--------------------
Olive oil (of which Spain is the world's largest producer) is extensively used in Spanish cuisine.[1][2] It forms the base of many vegetable sauces (known in Spanish as sofritos).[3] Herbs most commonly used include parsley, oregano, rosemary and thyme.[4] The use of garlic has been noted as common in Spanish cooking.[5] The most used meats in Spanish cuisine include chicken, pork, lamb and veal.[6] Fish and seafood are also consumed on a regular basis.[6] Tapas and pinchos are snacks and appetizers commonly served in bars and cafes.

Authors such as Strabo wrote about the aboriginal people of Spain using nuts and acorns as staple foods.[7] The extension of vineyards along the Mediterranean seems to be due to the colonization of Greeks and Phoenicians, who also introduced the production of olive oil. Spain is the largest producer of olive oil in the world. The growing of crops of the so-called tríada mediterránea (the "Mediterranean triad": wheat, the grapevine, and olives) underpinned the staple meal products for the inhabitants of the south of the Iberian Peninsula during the Roman Era (bread, wine and oil).[8]

The Visigoths' limited but lasting contributions to Spanish cuisine include the spread of consumption of fermented milk and the preference for avoiding the mixing of water and wine.[9]
--------------------
Rice was possibly introduced for the first time by Byzantines in the Iberian Peninsula by the 6th century. After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century, Arabs expanded rice cultivation,[10] bringing new irrigation techniques originally from the Indian subcontinent that also allowed for the cultivation of crops such as sugar cane, watermelon, lemon and oranges.[11] Other ingredients possibly introduced in the Iberian Peninsula during the Hispano-Muslim period include sorghum, spinach, eggplant, peach, apricot and saffron.[12] The most famous Spanish dish, paella, uses two ingredients that were probably popularized during the Al-Andalus period, rice and saffron.[13]
